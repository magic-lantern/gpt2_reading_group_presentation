Materials presented at CU Machine Learning Reading Group March 2019, organized by Debashis Ghosh, PhD.

My presentation is based on the paper:

Radford A, Wu J, Child R, Luan D, Amodei D, Sutskever I. Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners. Available at: https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf

A blog post by OpenAI:

The GPT-2 github repository:

This work is an extension of OpenAI's previous work, I highly recommend reading this as well:
